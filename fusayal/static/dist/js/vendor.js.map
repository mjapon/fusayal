See: [[Transition.to]] which returns the \"to state\"\n   * definition.\n   *\n   * @example\n   * ```js\n   * // ng1\n   * // state declaration\n   * {\n   *   name: 'home',\n   *   template: '<div ui-view/>',\n   *   defaultSubstate: 'home.dashboard'\n   * }\n   *\n   * var criteria = {\n   *   to: function(state) {\n   *     return state.defaultSubstate != null;\n   *   }\n   * }\n   *\n   * $transitions.onBefore(criteria, function(trans: Transition) {\n   *   var substate = trans.to().defaultSubstate;\n   *   return trans.router.stateService.target(substate);\n   * });\n   * ```\n   *\n   *\n   * #### Require authentication\n   *\n   * This example cancels a transition to a state which requires authentication, if the user is not currently authenticated.\n   *\n   * This example assumes a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'requireauth'` state.\n   * This example assumes `MyAuthService` synchronously returns a boolean from `isAuthenticated()`.\n   *\n   * #### Example:\n   * ```js\n   * // ng1\n   * $transitions.onBefore( { to: 'requireauth.**' }, function(trans) {\n   *   var myAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');\n   *   // If isAuthenticated returns false, the transition is cancelled.\n   *   return myAuthService.isAuthenticated();\n   * });\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.\n   * @param callback the hook function which will be invoked.\n   * @returns a function which deregisters the hook.\n   */\n  onBefore(matchCriteria: HookMatchCriteria, callback: TransitionHookFn, options?: HookRegOptions): Function;\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a [[TransitionHookFn]], called when a transition starts.\n   *\n   * Registers a transition lifecycle hook, which is invoked as a transition starts running.\n   * This hook can be useful to perform some asynchronous action before completing a transition.\n   *\n   * See [[TransitionHookFn]] for the signature of the function.\n   *\n   * The [[HookMatchCriteria]] is used to determine which Transitions the hook should be invoked for.\n   * To match all Transitions, use an empty criteria object `{}`.\n   *\n   * ### Lifecycle\n   *\n   * `onStart` hooks are invoked asynchronously when the Transition starts running.\n   * This happens after the `onBefore` phase is complete.\n   * At this point, the Transition has not yet exited nor entered any states.\n   * The registered `onStart` hooks are invoked in priority order.\n   *\n   * Note: A built-in `onStart` hook with high priority is used to fetch any eager resolve data.\n   *\n   * ### Return value\n   *\n   * The hook's return value can be used to pause, cancel, or redirect the current Transition.\n   * See [[HookResult]] for more information.\n   *\n   * ### Example\n   *\n   * #### Login during transition\n   *\n   * This example intercepts any transition to a state which requires authentication, when the user is\n   * not currently authenticated.  It allows the user to authenticate asynchronously, then resumes the\n   * transition.  If the user did not authenticate successfully, it redirects to the \"guest\" state, which\n   * does not require authentication.\n   *\n   * This example assumes:\n   * - a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'auth'` state.\n   * - `MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()` synchronously returns a boolean.\n   * - `MyAuthService.authenticate()` presents a login dialog, and returns a promise which is resolved\n   *   or rejected, whether or not the login attempt was successful.\n   *\n   * #### Example:\n   * ```js\n   * // ng1\n   * $transitions.onStart( { to: 'auth.**' }, function(trans) {\n   *   var $state = trans.router.stateService;\n   *   var MyAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');\n   *\n   *   // If the user is not authenticated\n   *   if (!MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()) {\n   *\n   *     // Then return a promise for a successful login.\n   *     // The transition will wait for this promise to settle\n   *\n   *     return MyAuthService.authenticate().catch(function() {\n   *\n   *       // If the authenticate() method failed for whatever reason,\n   *       // redirect to a 'guest' state which doesn't require auth.\n   *       return $state.target(\"guest\");\n   *     });\n   *   }\n   * });\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.\n   *

  * This example uses a service to log that a user has entered the admin section of an app.\n   * This assumes that there are substates of the \"admin\" state, such as \"admin.users\", \"admin.pages\", etc.\n   * @example\n   * ```\n   *\n   * $transitions.onEnter({ entering: 'admin' }, function(transition, state) {\n   *   var AuditService = trans.injector().get('AuditService');\n

Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters\n * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into\n * the matched parameters returned by [[UrlMatcher.exec]].\n *\n * - *Path parameters* are defined using curly brace placeholders (`/somepath/{param}`)\n * or colon placeholders (`/somePath/:param`).\n *\n * - *A parameter RegExp* may be defined for a param after a colon\n * (`/somePath/{param:[a-zA-Z0-9]+}`) in a curly brace placeholder.\n * The regexp must match for the url to be matched.\n * Should the regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.\n *\n * Note: a RegExp parameter will encode its value using either [[ParamTypes.path]] or [[ParamTypes.query]].\n *\n * - *Custom parameter types* may also be specified after a colon (`/somePath/{param:int}`) in curly brace parameters.\n *   See [[UrlMatcherFactory.type]] for more information.\n *\n * - *Catch-all parameters* are defined using an asterisk placeholder (`/somepath/*catchallparam`).\n *   A catch-all * parameter value will contain the remainder of the URL.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and\n * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters).\n * A path parameter matches any number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all\n * placeholders the path parameter matches any number of characters.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for\n *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.\n * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or\n *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n *   in the built-in  `date` ParamType matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n *\n */\nexport class UrlMatcher {\n  /** @hidden */\n  static nameValidator: RegExp = /^\\w+([-.]+\\w+)*(?:\\[\\])?$/;\n\n  /** @hidden */\n  private _cache: UrlMatcherCache = { path: [this] };\n  /** @hidden */\n  private _children: UrlMatcher[] = [];\n  /** @hidden */\n  private _params: Param[] = [];\n  /** @hidden */\n  private _segments: string[] = [];\n  /** @hidden */\n  private _compiled: string[] = [];\n  /** @hidden */\n  private readonly config: UrlMatcherCompileConfig;\n\n  /** The pattern that was passed into the constructor */\n  public pattern: string;\n\n  /** @hidden */\n  static encodeDashes(str: string) {\n    // Replace dashes with encoded \"\\-\"\n    return encodeURIComponent(str).replace(\n      /-/g,\n      c =>\n        `%5C%${c\n          .charCodeAt(0)\n          .toString(16)\n          .toUpperCase()}`\n    );\n  }\n\n  /** @hidden Given a matcher, return an array with the matcher's path segments and path params, in order */\n  static pathSegmentsAndParams(matcher: UrlMatcher) {\n    const staticSegments = matcher._segments;\n    const pathParams = matcher._params.filter(p => p.location === DefType.PATH);\n    return arrayTuples(staticSegments, pathParams.concat(undefined))\n      .reduce(unnestR, [])\n      .filter(x => x !== '' && isDefined(x));\n  }\n\n  /** @hidden Given a matcher, return an array with the matcher's query params */\n  static queryParams(matcher: UrlMatcher): Param[] {\n    return matcher._params.filter(p => p.location === DefType.SEARCH);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Compare two UrlMatchers\n   *\n   * This comparison function converts a UrlMatcher into static and dynamic path segments.\n   * Each static path segment is a static string between a path separator (slash character).\n   * Each dynamic segment is a path parameter.\n   *\n   * The comparison function sorts static segments before dynamic ones.\n   */\n  static compare(a: UrlMatcher, b: UrlMatcher): number {\n    /**\n     * Turn a UrlMatcher and all its parent matchers into an array\n     * of slash literals '/', string literals, and Param objects\n     *\n     * This example matcher matches strings like \"/foo/:param/tail\":\n     * var matcher = $umf.compile(\"/foo\").append($umf.compile(\"/:param\")).append($umf.compile(\"/\")).append($umf.compile(\"tail\"));\n     * var result = segments(matcher); // [ '/', 'foo', '/', Param, '/', 'tail' ]\n     *\n     * Caches the result as `matcher._cache.segments`\n     */\n    const segments = (matcher: UrlMatcher) =>\n      (matcher._cache.segments =\n        matcher._cache.segments ||\n        matcher._cache.path\n          .map(UrlMatcher.pathSegmentsAndParams)\n          .reduce(unnestR, [])\n          .reduce(joinNeighborsR, [])\n          .map(x => (isString(x) ?

links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * ### Linked State\n * The attribute value of the `ui-sref` is the name of the state to link to.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This will activate the `home` state when the link is clicked.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Relative Links\n * You can also use relative state paths within `ui-sref`, just like a relative path passed to `$state.go()` ([[StateService.go]]).\n * You just need to be aware that the path is relative to the state that *created* the link.\n * This allows a state to create a relative `ui-sref` which always targets the same destination.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Both these links are relative to the parent state, even when a child state is currently active.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\".child1\">child 1 state</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\".child2\">child 2 state</a>\n * ```\n *\n * This link activates the parent state.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"^\">Return</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### hrefs\n * If the linked state has a URL, the directive will automatically generate and\n * update the `href` attribute (using the [[StateService.href]]  method).\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Assuming the `users` state has a url of `/users/`\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"users\" href=\"/users/\">Users</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Parameter Values\n * In addition to the state name, a `ui-sref` can include parameter values which are applied when activating the state.\n * Param values can be provided in the `ui-sref` value after the state name, enclosed by parentheses.\n * The content inside the parentheses is an expression, evaluated to the parameter values.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This example renders a list of links to users.\n * The state's `userId` parameter value comes from each user's `user.id` property.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"users.detail({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * Note:\n * The parameter values expression is `$watch`ed for updates.\n *\n * ### Transition Options\n * You can specify [[TransitionOptions]] to pass to [[StateService.go]] by using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n * Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`, and `reload`.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ reload: true }\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Other DOM Events\n *\n * You can also customize which DOM events to respond to (instead of `click`) by\n * providing an `events` array in the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\" ui-sref=\"contacts\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ events: ['change', 'blur'] }\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Highlighting the active link\n * This directive can be used in conjunction with [[uiSrefActive]] to highlight the active link.\n *\n * ### Examples\n * If you have the following template:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">{{ contact.name }}</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Then (assuming the current state is `contacts`) the rendered html including hrefs would be:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a href=\"#/home\" ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a href=\"#/about\" ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n * <a href=\"#/contacts?page=2\" ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n *

linking to a state\n *\n * A directive which links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * **This directive is very similar to [[uiSref]], but it `$observe`s and `$watch`es/evaluates all its inputs.**\n *\n * A directive which links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * ### Linked State\n * The attribute value of `ui-state` is an expression which is `$watch`ed and evaluated as the state to link to.\n * **This is in contrast with `ui-sref`, which takes a state name as a string literal.**\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Create a list of links.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"link in navlinks\">\n *   <a ui-state=\"link.state\">{{ link.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Relative Links\n * If the expression evaluates to a relative path, it is processed like [[uiSref]].\n * You just need to be aware that the path is relative to the state that *created* the link.\n * This allows a state to create relative `ui-state` which always targets the same destination.\n *\n * ### hrefs\n * If the linked state has a URL, the directive will automatically generate and\n * update the `href` attribute (using the [[StateService.href]]  method).\n *\n * ### Parameter Values\n * In addition to the state name expression, a `ui-state` can include parameter values which are applied when activating the state.\n * Param values should be provided using the `ui-state-params` attribute.\n * The `ui-state-params` attribute value is `$watch`ed and evaluated as an expression.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This example renders a list of links with param values.\n * The state's `userId` parameter value comes from each user's `user.id` property.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"link in navlinks\">\n *   <a ui-state=\"link.state\" ui-state-params=\"link.params\">{{ link.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Options\n * You can specify [[TransitionOptions]] to pass to [[StateService.go]] by using the `ui-state-opts` attribute.\n * Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`, and `reload`.\n * The value of the `ui-state-opts` is `$watch`ed and evaluated as an expression.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <a ui-state=\"returnto.state\" ui-state-opts=\"{ reload: true }\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Other DOM Events\n *\n * You can also customize which DOM events to respond to (instead of `click`) by\n * providing an `events` array in the `ui-state-opts` attribute.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\" ui-state=\"contacts\" ui-state-opts=\"{ events: ['change', 'blur'] }\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Highlighting the active link\n * This directive can be used in conjunction with [[uiSrefActive]] to highlight the active link.\n *\n * ### Notes\n *\n * - You can use `ui-params` to change **only the parameter values** by omitting the state name and supplying only `ui-state-params`.\n *   However, it might be simpler to use [[uiSref]] parameter-only links.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Sets the `lang` parameter to `en` and remains on the same state.\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-state=\"\" ui-state-params=\"{ lang: 'en' }\">English</a>\n * ```\n *\n * - A middle-click, right-click, or ctrl-click is handled (natively) by the browser to open the href in a new window, for example.\n * ```\n */\nlet uiStateDirective: ng1_directive;\nuiStateDirective = [\n

and `ui-sref-active-eq`: A directive that adds a CSS class when a `ui-sref` is active\n *\n * A directive working alongside [[uiSref]] and [[uiState]] to add classes to an element when the\n * related directive's state is active (and remove them when it is inactive).\n *\n * The primary use-case is to highlight the active link in navigation menus,\n * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.\n *\n * ### Linking to a `ui-sref` or `ui-state`\n * `ui-sref-active` can live on the same element as `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, or it can be on a parent element.\n * If a `ui-sref-active` is a parent to more than one `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, it will apply the CSS class when **any of the links are active**.\n *\n * ### Matching\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state **or any child state is active**.\n * This is a \"fuzzy match\" which uses [[StateService.includes]].\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active-eq` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state is directly active (not when child states are active).\n * This is an \"exact match\" which uses [[StateService.is]].\n *\n * ### Parameter values\n * If the `ui-sref`/`ui-state` includes parameter values, the current parameter values must match the link's values for the link to be highlighted.\n * This allows a list of links to the same state with different parameters to be rendered, and the correct one highlighted.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\" ui-sref-active=\"active\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"user.details({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.lastName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Examples\n *\n * Given the following template:\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item\">\n *     <a href ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * When the app state is `app.user` (or any child state),\n * and contains the state parameter \"user\" with value \"bilbobaggins\",\n * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):\n *\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item active\">\n *     <a ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\" href=\"/users/bilbobaggins\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Glob mode\n *\n * It is possible to pass `ui-sref-active` an expression that evaluates to an object.\n * The objects keys represent active class names and values represent the respective state names/globs.\n * `ui-sref-active` will match if the current active state **includes** any of\n * the specified state names/globs, even the abstract ones.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Given the following template, with \"admin\" being an abstract state:\n * ```html\n * <div ui-sref-active=\"{'active': 'admin.**'}\">\n *   <a ui-sref-active=\"active\" ui-sref=\"admin.roles\">Roles</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Arrays are also supported as values in the `ngClass`-like interface.\n * This allows multiple states to add `active` class.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Given the following template, with \"admin.roles\" being the current state, the class will be added too:\n * ```html\n * <div ui-sref-active=\"{'active': ['owner.**', 'admin.**']}\">\n *   <a ui-sref-active=\"active\" ui-sref=\"admin.roles\">Roles</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the current state is \"admin.roles\" the \"active\" class will be applied to both the `<div>` and `<a>` elements.\n * It is important to note that the state names/globs passed to `ui-sref-active` override any state provided by a linked `ui-sref`.\n *\n * ### Notes:\n *\n * - The class name is interpolated **once** during the directives link time (any further changes to the\n * interpolated value are ignored).\n *\n * - Multiple classes may be specified in a space-separated format: `ui-sref-active='class1 class2 class3'`\n

be unique amongst the other views in the same state.\n *   You can have views of the same name that live in different states.\n *   The ui-view can be targeted in a View using the name ([[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]]).\n *\n * - `autoscroll`: an expression. When it evaluates to true, the `ui-view` will be scrolled into view when it is activated.\n *   Uses [[$uiViewScroll]] to do the scrolling.\n *\n * - `onload`: Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * A view can be unnamed or named.\n * ```html\n * <!-- Unnamed -->\n * <div ui-view></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named -->\n * <div ui-view=\"viewName\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named (different style) -->\n * <ui-view name=\"viewName\"></ui-view>\n * ```\n *\n * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a\n * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the\n * [[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]] config property, by name, in this case an empty name:\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view\n * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,\n * but you could if you wanted, like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view=\"main\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"main\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"chart\"></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"data\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     },\n *     \"chart\": {\n *       template: \"<chart_thing/>\"\n *     },\n *     \"data\": {\n *       template: \"<data_thing/>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * #### Examples for `autoscroll`:\n * ```html\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll/>\n *\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>\n * ```\n *\n * Resolve data:\n *\n * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this\n * can be customized using [[Ng1ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.\n *\n * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the\n * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which\n * depends on `$resolve` data.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n *   template: '<my-component user=\"$resolve.user\"></my-component>',\n *   resolve: {\n *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n */\nexport let uiView:
